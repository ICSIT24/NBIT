                <p>I'm a programmer and database master, a kind of hybrid creature that lives in the digital realm. I
                    speak the languages of code and query, crafting applications that dance with data. I build the
                    frameworks that hold information, ensuring it's stored securely, accessed efficiently, and
                    manipulated with precision. My world is one of logic and structure, where I find satisfaction in
                    optimizing performance, ensuring data integrity, and designing elegant data models. I'm a problem
                    solver, an analytical thinker, and a meticulous craftsman, ensuring that data is the lifeblood of
                    any application I touch.</p>

                <p>I'm a researcher, a nomad of knowledge, constantly seeking new frontiers of understanding. My days
                    are
                    spent delving into the depths of information, piecing together the puzzle of the world, one research
                    paper, one interview, one observation at a time. But I'm also a freelance woman, a master of my own
                    time and schedule. I trade my skills and expertise for the freedom to choose my projects, set my own
                    pace, and explore the world on my own terms. It's a balancing act, this life of research and
                    freelance, but it's a dance I've learned to embrace. The constant learning, the creative freedom,
                    and the ability to make a difference, all while being my own boss, is a journey I wouldn't trade for
                    anything. </p>

    <p>ICSIT24</p>
    <p>Student Enrollment Evaluation</p>

    <p>A Project Presented to the</p>
    <p>Faculty of the College of Computer Studies</p>
    <p>Northern Bukidnon State College</p>



    <p>Objective:

    <p>To design and implement an efficient, user-friendly site enrollment evaluation that streamlines the process of
        enrolling, tracking, and managing research participants. The system will ensure accurate data collection,
        improve communication between researchers and participants, and provide timely access to essential information
        for better decision-making.</p>

    <p>The goal is to design and implement a comprehensive and efficient enrollment system that optimizes the process
        of enrolling, tracking, and managing the participants. This system will aim to streamline each phase of
        participant involvement, from initial recruitment to ongoing engagement throughout the course of the site. By
        providing a centralized platform, the system will facilitate accurate and seamless data collection, ensuring
        that all participant information is captured and stored securely in real time.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the system will improve communication between sites and students by offering automated thereby
        reducing the administrative burden on both parties. Researchers will benefit from an easy-to-use interface that
        allows them to monitor participant progress, track compliance, and manage scheduling efficiently. This will lead
        to faster response times, better coordination, and fewer delays in the research process.</p>

    <p>Participants will also experience a more user-friendly interface, with intuitive navigation for managing their
        involvement in studies, receiving updates, and accessing any relevant documentation or consent forms. The system
        will include features to enhance participant engagement, such as the ability to track their own progress and
        receive timely reminders for study-related tasks.</p>


    <p>By providing these functionalities, the site enrollment evaluation will not only improve the efficiency and
        accuracy of data collection but will also contribute to higher-quality research outcomes, better participant
        experiences, and enhanced research management capabilities overall.</p>


    <p>Note on pins: blue ( start or where to go next) Green(Signed) Red ( Not yet)</p>




    <p>This is our Map.js Initialization</p>


    <p>class LeafletMap {</p>

    <p>constructor(containerId, center, zoom) {</p>

    <p>this.map = L.map(containerId).setView(center, zoom);</p>

    <p>this.initTileLayer();</p>

    <p>}</p>


    <p>initTileLayer() {</p>

    <p>const icons = {</p>

    <p>red: 'images/red-location-marker-icon-on-a-white-background-</p>





    <p>User Instructions</p>

    <p>Get your Enrollment Slip and just open your phone Login and you will see where to get Signage first. Blue for
        Starting location or Next Location,Green for Done and Red for not available yet. Meaning must go to Blue pins
        first once you get signed that Pins will turn green and the next location will change from red to blue.</p>




    <p>This part is the description and work position of the member of the ICSIT24</p>

    <p>In conclusion our group made a map for the enrollment evaluation system for the students' guide to our
        enrollment process.</p>
